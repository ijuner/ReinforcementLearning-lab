    "### Introduction\n",
    "Individuals will work with the Pong environment and implement Deep Q-Learning. In this environment, if we got the right and left paddle's positions as the state, we would have continuous states that prevent the use of a tabular solutions, and thus the use of Q-Learning. To solve this problem, you will use a neural network to represent the function with Deep Q Networks and use the game frames as the observation. The way you interact with the environment will be very similar to the Ms. Pacman gym environment used in class.\n",

    "The environment has an observation space of size (210,160,3), which is an RGB image with values between 0 and 255.\n",
